1. propmetheus

If you installed Prometheus without the role “system:auth-delegator” you need to 
provide a name for the datasource such as “Promtheus-OCP”.
 


2. We need to grant the Grafana service account view access to the project 
“prometheus” with the following command, so that Grafana can display data 
from Prometheus:

oc policy add-role-to-user view system:serviceaccount:grafana:grafana-ocp -n prometheus
