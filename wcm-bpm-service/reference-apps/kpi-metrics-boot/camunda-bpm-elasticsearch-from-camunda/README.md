camunda-bpm-elasticsearch combines the camunda-bpm platform with the powerful search capabilities of ElasticSearch.
It comes with a process engine plugin which indexes all generated history events through ElasticSearch.
To use the indexed data, a cockpit plugin is also provided to allow querying and retrieval of process instances through ElasticSearch.
