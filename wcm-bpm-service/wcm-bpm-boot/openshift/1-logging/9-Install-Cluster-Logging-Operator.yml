> Install the Cluster Logging Operator using the OpenShift Container Platform 
  web console for best results:

  In the OpenShift Container Platform web console, click Operators → OperatorHub.

  Choose Cluster Logging from the list of available Operators, and click Install.

  On the Create Operator Subscription page, under A specific namespace on 
  the cluster select openshift-logging. Then, click Subscribe.

> Verify the operator installations:

  Switch to the Operators → Installed Operators page.

  Ensure that Cluster Logging and Elasticsearch Operator are listed on 
  the InstallSucceeded tab with a Status of InstallSucceeded. Change the 
  project to all projects if necessary.

  During installation an operator might display a Failed status. If the operator 
  then installs with an InstallSucceeded message, you can safely ignore the 
  Failed message.

  If either operator does not appear as installed, to troubleshoot further:

    Switch to the Operators → Installed Operators page and inspect the Status 
    column for any errors or failures.
  
    Switch to the Workloads → Pods page and check the logs in any Pods in the 
    openshift-logging and openshift-operators-redhat projects that are reporting 
    issues.

> Create a cluster logging instance:

  Switch to the Administration → Custom Resource Definitions page.

  On the Custom Resource Definitions page, click ClusterLogging.

  On the Custom Resource Definition Overview page, select View Instances 
  from the Actions menu.

  On the Cluster Loggings page, click Create Cluster Logging.

  You might have to refresh the page to load the data.

  In the YAML, replace the code with the following:

  This default cluster logging configuration should support a wide array of e
  nvironments. Review the topics on tuning and configuring the cluster logging components for information on modifications you can make 
  to your cluster logging cluster.

    apiVersion: "logging.openshift.io/v1"
    kind: "ClusterLogging"
    metadata:
      name: "instance" 
      namespace: "openshift-logging"
    spec:
      managementState: "Managed"  
      logStore:
        type: "elasticsearch"  
        elasticsearch:
          nodeCount: 3
          resources:
            limits:
              memory: 2Gi
          requests:
            cpu: 200m
            memory: 2Gi
          storage:
            storageClassName: es
            size: 5G
          redundancyPolicy: "SingleRedundancy"
      visualization:
        type: "kibana"  
        kibana:
          replicas: 1
      curation:
        type: "curator"  
        curator:
          schedule: "30 3 * * *"
      collection:
        logs:
          type: "fluentd"  
          fluentd: {}


    NOTE: about managementState: "Managed"
    The cluster logging management state. In most cases, if you change the default 
    cluster logging defaults, you must set this to Unmanaged. However, an unmanaged 
    deployment does not receive updates until the cluster logging is placed back 
    into a managed state
    
      
    The maximum number of Elasticsearch master nodes is three. If you specify 
    a nodeCount greater than 3, OpenShift Container Platform creates three 
    Elasticsearch nodes that are Master-eligible nodes, with the master, client, 
    and data roles. The additional Elasticsearch nodes are created as Data-only 
    nodes, using client and data roles. 

  Click Create. This creates the Cluster Logging Custom Resource and Elasticsearch 
  Custom Resource, which you can edit to make changes to your cluster logging 
  cluster.

> Verify the install:

  Switch to the Workloads → Pods page.

  Select the openshift-logging project.

  You should see several pods for 
  cluster logging, Elasticsearch, Fluentd, and Kibana similar to the 
  following list:

    cluster-logging-operator-cb795f8dc-xkckc
    
    elasticsearch-cdm-b3nqzchd-1-5c6797-67kfz
    
    elasticsearch-cdm-b3nqzchd-2-6657f4-wtprv
    
    elasticsearch-cdm-b3nqzchd-3-588c65-clg7g
    
    fluentd-2c7dg

    fluentd-9z7kk
    
    fluentd-br7r2
    
    fluentd-fn2sb
    
    fluentd-pb2f8
    
    fluentd-zqgqx
    
    kibana-7fb4fd4cc9-bvt4p
